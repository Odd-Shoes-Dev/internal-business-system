## 💳 Stripe Online Payment Integration (DEFERRED)

### Current Status
The system has Stripe integration code in place but needs configuration and testing:

**Files Implemented:**
- `/pay?id=invoice_id` - Customer payment page with Stripe Elements
- `src/app/pay/PayClient.tsx` - Stripe payment form component
- `src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` - Auto-records payments via webhook
- `src/lib/stripe.ts` - Stripe helper functions

**What Works:**
- Customer can visit payment link and see invoice details
- Stripe payment form loads with card input fields
- Webhook automatically records payment when received
- Auto-updates invoice status to "paid"
- Creates payment record, journal entry, and updates customer balance

**What's Needed:**
1. **Environment Variables:**
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Your Stripe secret key
   - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Webhook signing secret
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Public key for client

2. **Stripe Account Setup:**
   - Create Stripe account at stripe.com
   - Get API keys from dashboard
   - Configure webhook endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
   - Subscribe to `payment_intent.succeeded` event

3. **Testing:**
   - Test with Stripe test mode first
   - Use test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
   - Verify payment records correctly
   - Test webhook delivery
   - Confirm invoice status updates

4. **Email Integration:**
   - Add payment link to invoice emails
   - Format: `Click here to pay: https://yourdomain.com/pay?id={invoice_id}`

5. **Security:**
   - Ensure HTTPS in production
   - Verify webhook signatures
   - Add payment page rate limiting

**Priority:** LOW - Nice to have, not essential for launch  
**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours for configuration and testing  
**Documentation:** Will create `STRIPE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` when ready to implement
